## Getting started

1.  [Installation](#installation)
1.  [Configuration](#configuration)
1.  [Third-party scripts configuration](#third-party-scripts-configuration)
1.  [Initialization](#initialization)

### Installation

Orejime comes with many styles and languages. It is distributed as individual
modules that follow a common convention, namely `orejime-[THEME]-[LANGUAGE]`.
For example:

- `orejime-standard-en.js` uses the standard theme with english texts
- `orejime-standard-fr.js` uses the standard theme with french texts
- `orejime-dsfr-fr.js` uses the DSFR theme with french texts

(Learn more about [themes](#theming) & [languages](#internationalization))

#### Content Delivery Network

The easiest way to use Orejime is to import a distribution via a CDN such as
jsDelivr:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/orejime@latest/dist/orejime-standard-en.js"></script>
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/orejime@latest/dist/orejime-standard.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

> [!TIP] If you're using this method, please avoid using the `@latest` version.
> Prefer a fixed one like `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/orejime@3.0.0/…`. That
> way you can ensure you will not be impacted by a change of API or a potential
> bug that could land in the latest version.

#### npm

Orejime only distributes built files via npm
([learn why](./adr/001-distribution-formats.md)).

```sh
npm install orejime
```

You'll find the required JS and CSS files in the `dist` folder.

### Configuration

You need to pass Orejime some configuration for it to function. This is
typically done by assigning configuration options to `window.orejimeConfig`:

```html
<script>
  window.orejimeConfig = {
    // options
  };
</script>
```

You'll find all the available configuration options below.

> [!NOTE] Very few of the following options are actually required (only
> `purposes` and `privacyPolicyUrl` are). Optional options are explicitly
> flagged as such.

<summary>Annotated example of configuration</summary>

```js
var orejimeConfig = {
  // You must provide a link to your privacy policy page for GDPR compliance.
  privacyPolicyUrl: '',

  // The list of third-party purposes that Orejime will manage for you.
  // The purposes will appear in the modal in the same order as defined here.
  purposes: [

      description:
        'This is an example of how to override an existing translation already used by Orejime'
    }
  },

  // [optional]
  // You can pass an image url to show in the notice.
  // If the image is not exclusively decorative, you can pass an object
  // with the image `src` and `alt` attributes: `logo: {src: '...', alt: '...'}`
  logo: '/img/logo.png',

  // [optional]
  // You can customize the element that will contain Orejime (either

  cookie: {
    // [optional]
    // You can customize the name of the cookie that Orejime uses for storing
    // user consent decisions.
    // (defaults to 'orejime')
    name: 'orejime',

    // [optional]
    // You can set a custom expiration time for the Orejime cookie, in days.
    // (defaults to 365.)

    parse: (cookie) => JSON.parse(cookie)
  }
};
```

> [!IMPORTANT] If every purpose is either `isMandatory` or `isExempt`, Orejime
> will not show at startup (it will still be possible to open it
> programmatically). However, you should consider this use case carefully, and
> ensure that :
>
> - `isMandatory` trackers are truly required for your app to function properly
> - `isExempt` trackers are exempt from consent (i.e.
>   [as defined by the CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-solutions-pour-les-outils-de-mesure-daudience))

</details>

### Third-party scripts configuration

Scripts that require user consent must not be executed when the page load.
Orejime will take care of loading them when the user has consented.

Those scripts must be tagged with their related purpose from the configuration.
This is done by wrapping them with a template tag and a `data-purpose`
attribute:

```diff
+ <template data-purpose="google-tag-manager">
    <script>
      (function(w,d,s,l,i){/* … */})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXX')
    </script>
+ </template>
```

This way, the original script is left untouched, and any piece of HTML can be
controlled by Orejime in the same way.

You can wrap many elements at once or use several templates with the same
purpose:

```html
<template data-purpose="ads">
  <script src="https://annoying-ads.net"></script>
  <script src="https://intrusive-advertising.io"></script>
</template>

<template data-purpose="ads">
  <iframe src="https://streaming.ads-24-7.com/orejime"></iframe>
</template>
```

> [!NOTE] There is more you can do with templates! Learn about
> [contextual consent](#contextual-consent).

<details>
<summary>Integration tips</summary>

#### WordPress

Should you use Orejime in a WordPress website, you could alter the rendering of
the script tags it should handle:

```php
// Register a script somewhere…
wp_enqueue_script('matomo', 'matomo.js');

// …and change the script output to wrap it in a template.
function orejimeScriptLoader($tag, $handle, $src) {
    if ($handle === 'matomo') {
        return '<template data-purpose="analytics">' + $tag + '</template>';
    }

    return $tag;
}

add_filter('script_loader_tag', 'orejimeScriptLoader', 10, 3);

```

</details>

### Initialization

Now that you installed and configured Orejime, you should see it greet you!

Anytime the `window.orejimeConfig` variable is set with a valid configuration,
Orejime will pick it up and start.

In case you don't set this variable, Orejime can still be launched
programatically by passing it a configuration:

```js
Orejime.init(orejimeConfig);
```

> [!NOTE] Previously, Orejime could be imported as any other module and bundled
> into application code. With version 3, we're abandonning this functionality to
> provide standalone builds only
> ([learn why](./adr/001-distribution-formats.md)).

### Theming

#### Standard theme

This is a custom theme meant to be simple but elegant enough to be used as-is on
any website. It is easily customizable by tweaking some CSS properties.

You can either replace the original CSS entirely, or add your custom stylesheet
to overwrite only some of the rules.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="orejime.css" />

<style>
  .orejime-Env {
    --orejime-font-family: monospace;
    --orejime-color-background: black;
    --orejime-color-text: yellow;
  }
</style>
```

You'll find the available CSS properties in
[the theme's stylesheet](src/ui/themes/standard/index.css).

#### DSFR theme

This theme is meant to be used on websites using the official design system of
the french government. As those sites already include the DSFR styles, this
theme does not provide any styles of its own but only makes use of the correct
markup and class names.

See the
[consent manager component](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/composants-et-modeles/composants/gestionnaire-de-consentement)
on the DSFR docs for an overview.

### Internationalization

Orejime is available in most european languages: Catalan, Dutch, English,
Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Occitan,
Romanian, Spanish, Swedish.

> [!NOTE] Each and every translated text is overridable via
> [the configuration](#configuration).

### Contextual consent

Content embedded from other websites might be restricted by user consent (i.e. a
YouTube video).

In that case, using templates would work just like with scripts:

```js
<template data-purpose="youtube">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toto"></iframe>
</template>
```

However, this won't show anything until the user consents to the related
purpose.

To be a little more user friendly, adding the `data-contextual` attribute will
display a fallback notice until consent is given, detailing the reason and
offering a way to consent in place.

```diff
- <template data-purpose="youtube">
+ <template data-purpose="youtube" data-contextual>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/toto"></iframe>
  </template>
```

<details>
<summary>Integration tips</summary>

#### WordPress

Should you use Orejime in a WordPress website, you could alter the rendering of
embeds so they use contextual consent:

```php
function orejimeWrapEmbeds($content, $block) {
	if ($block['blockName'] === 'core/embed') {
		return '<template data-purpose="embeds" data-contextual>' . $content . '</template>';
	}

	return $content;
}

add_filter('render_block', 'orejimeWrapEmbeds', 10, 2);
```

</details>

## API

Functions and references are made available on the global scope:

- `loadOrejime(config)`: creates a new Orejime instance with the given config
  object

### Orejime instance

- `orejime.prompt()`: opens the consent modal
- `orejime.manager`: the core consent manager
- `orejime.config`: the complete config object used

### Manager

The manager handles the core functionality of Orejime.

- `orejime.manager.getConsent(purposeId)`: tells if the user has given consent
  to a given purpose
- `orejime.manager.setConsent(purposeId, consent)`: sets consent to a given
  purpose
- `orejime.manager.clearConsents()`: resets consents as if the user never
  interacted with Orejime (this will reopen the banner)
- `orejime.manager.acceptAll()`: gives consent to all purposes
- `orejime.manager.declineAll()`: revokes consent to all purposes

#### Events

The manager emits events to which you might subscribe to implement side effects:

```js
orejime.manager.on('update', function (updatedConsents, allConsents) {
  // Consent was granted or denied on some purposes.
  // `updatedConsents` is an object with purpose ids as
  // keys and consent state as values that holds only
  // updated purposes.
  // `allConsents` is similar to `updatedConsents` but
  // contains every purpose configured.
});

orejime.manager.on('clear', function () {
  // All consents have been reset to their default state.
  // This happens after a call to `orejime.manager.clearConsents()`.
});

orejime.manager.on('dirty', function (isDirty) {
  // If `isDirty` is true, the menager is in a state where
  // the consents given don't satisfy the constraints of
  // their related purposes (for example, a purpose with
  // the flag `isMandatory` requires explicit consent from
  // the user).
});
```

(See `src/core/Manager.ts` for a complete overview)

## Migrating

### Version 3

A major overhaul of the configuration took place in this version, as to clarify
naming and align more with the GDPR vocabulary.

#### Configuration

If you were already using version 2, a tool to migrate your current
configuration is available here : https://orejime.boscop.fr/#migration.

#### Third-party scripts

Previous versions of Orejime required you to alter third party script tags. This
behavior has changed, and you should now leave scripts untouched and wrap them
in a template, as documented in
[scripts configuration](#third-party-scripts-configuration)
([learn why](./adr/003-purpose-templates.md)).

As you can see from the following example, this is simpler and less intrusive:

```diff
- <script
-   type="opt-in"
-   data-type="application/javascript"
-   data-name="google-maps"
-   data-src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js"
- ></script>
+ <template data-purpose="google-maps">
+   <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js"></script>
+ </template>
```

## Development

If you want to contribute to Orejime, or make a custom build for yourself, clone
the project and run these commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can then open the demo page at `http://localhost:3000`, which will be
reloaded automatically whenever the JS or CSS changes.

## License & credits

This project is licensed under a BSD-3 license.

Orejime started as a fork of [Klaro!](https://github.com/KIProtect/klaro). A lot
of stuff changed since. A few were integrated in the original project, but
eventually some big bricks changed and it became difficult, or sometimes not
even necessary, to push those changes in.

Orejime is maintained by [Boscop (French)](http://boscop.fr).

### What does "Orejime" mean?

"Orejime" is a play-on-word. You can pronounce it like "Au régime" in French,
which means "on a diet".
