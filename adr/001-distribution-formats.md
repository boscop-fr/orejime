# Distribution formats

## Context

Orejime can be consumed in different ways : via a CDN, by copying and hosting the built assets, or by bundling it with client code. This sums up to two categories : *standalone* and *bundled*.

Those categories each impose different constraints to the Orejime's API, the way it is built and distributed.

## Considerations

* When used as a standalone module, it does not need to wait for the whole client code to load with it so it can load faster.
* When used as a standalone module, it can be cached separately by the browser. It is likely that Orejime and the client code won't have the same rate of update, so Orejime could be cached for longer.
* Providing access to Orejime's source ties client code to it. The build system has to be able to handle it, and it imposes hard constraints on the technologies we use. For example, we are using a compatibility layer for React over Preact for the sole purpose of letting people use Orejime inside React projects. As we upgrade Orejime over time, we want to be able to change the whole underlying code (for performance, smaller footprint, ...) without breaking everyone's builds.
* We're working hard on optimizing every last bit of Orejime, and it has to do with the technologies we choose, the build pipeline, the way the app is split into small modules, and so on. Sadly, this can all be lost when the app is build another way.

## Decision

Given the previous reasons, letting one build Orejime themselves might be a burden on them and on us, for no added value.

We will discontinue the distribution of ESM and CJS modules, as to prevent this use entirely.

One could still import Orejime from source to bundle it themselves, but it would now be their own responsibility to maintain it, as we couldn't guarantee not to introduce breaking changes.
