					<h2>Privacy policy</h2>

					<p>
						While you browse this website, we (BOSCOP) may collect
						information about you: personal data! We are committed to
						ensuring that the collection and use of this data comply with
						regulations designed to protect personal data, including the
						well-known GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive (mainly concerning
						cookies), the French Data Protection Act (Cocorico), as well
						as various recommendations and guidelines from the CNIL and
						the EDPB.
					</p>

					<h3>Why do we collect your data?</h3>

					<h4>Action logging (logs)</h4>

					<p>
						First and foremost, like on any website, technical traces of
						your visit are recorded when you load a page or resources
						(commonly known as the TCP-IP protocol ☝️). Simply put, in
						order to display an image in your browser, our servers need to
						retrieve your IP address to send you the requested image. In
						doing so, what we call "logs" are recorded on our servers,
						including the timestamp of the action and your IP address.
					</p>

					<p>
						Beyond their use within the TCP-IP protocol, these logs help
						secure our website: ideally to prevent security incidents, but
						also to identify their origin if an incident occurs.
					</p>

					<p>
						This data collection serves a legitimate interest of Boscop:
						ensuring the proper and secure operation of its website. This
						interest remains within the reasonable expectations of a user,
						as action logging is a common practice.
					</p>

					<p>⌛ These logs are automatically deleted after one year.</p>

					<h4>Cookies</h4>

					<p>
						A "cookie" is a small file made up of letters and numbers,
						placed or read on your computer, for example, during your
						navigation on our website.
					</p>

					<p>
						This website showcases a cookie manager, meaning that certain
						cookies may be placed on your device if you interact with the
						presented examples.
					</p>

					<p>
						In practice, we only use anonymized audience measurement
						cookies (which do not involve the collection of personal data
						in the strict sense). These cookies allow us to understand how
						our website is used, assess its performance, generate
						statistics, and analyse traffic volumes and user interactions
						(visited sections, content engagement, navigation paths). This
						helps us improve the relevance and usability of our services.
					</p>

					<p>
						To conduct these analyses, we use Matomo, an open-source
						audience measurement tool hosted on our own servers. The
						following cookies are used: "_pk_ref", "_pk_id", "_pk_ses",
						"visitor", "visit".
					</p>

					<p>
						We have configured Matomo according to the CNIL-approved
						guidelines, meaning your consent is not required for their
						use. However, you always have the right to opt out!
					</p>

					<div class="Tile Theme--primary">
						<div id="matomo-opt-out"></div>
						<script src="https://matomo.boscop.io/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOutJS&divId=matomo-opt-out&language=en&showIntro=1"></script>
					</div>

					<h4>Contact Form</h4>

					<p>
						When you contact us via our contact form, we collect personal
						information such as your first name, last name, email address,
						etc. (basically, the data you fill in the form).
					</p>

					<p>
						We need to collect the fields marked as "mandatory" to process
						your request and get back to you (another legitimate
						interest!). If you wish to be contacted by phone, you can
						indicate it. You may also provide details about your
						organization to refine your request.
					</p>

					<p>
						If your inquiry relates to our services, our response may,
						quite logically, be considered commercial prospecting—but
						don’t worry, you can object at any time to receiving
						commercial information.
					</p>

					<p>
						⌛ The duration for which we keep your data depends on the
						nature of your request and any contractual relationship that
						may follow. For example, 3 years after an inquiry about our
						services, or, if we collaborate, for the duration of the
						contract + 5 years.
					</p>

					<h3>Who will have access to my data?</h3>

					<p>
						In addition to Boscop’s own infrastructure, we utilize several
						third-party solutions hosted in the United States: Bugsnag
						(hosted by Google) and Netlify (hosted by Amazon).
					</p>

					<p>
						Your data is protected under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
						Framework, ensuring compliance with European data protection
						standards.
					</p>

					<h3>How can I get more information or exercise my rights?</h3>

					<p>
						First, you can visit the CNIL website to learn more about your
						rights under the French Data Protection Act and how to
						exercise them. ⚖️
					</p>

					<p>
						You have the right to access, rectify, and, in some cases,
						delete your data. You also have the right to object to data
						processing, particularly regarding commercial prospecting or
						the retention of your CV.
					</p>

					<p>
						For any requests or further information, you can contact
						Boscop’s Data Protection Officer (DPO):
